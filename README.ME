            https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v3GVClKDoLs4aSeJGOvs4v2jrSA1l2lS/view?usp=sharing
        2.put the ckpt_pretrained.pt into the folder shared/ckpt, there should be a file named here-should-have-ckpts.
    the generator part is designed to interact with Yamaha Disklavier piano, if you use another deivce, you may need to adjust it based on your deivce
    if you want to train the model yourself, feel free to adjust the parameter realated in config.py, but rember to adjust the PROJECT_NAME and ENTITY_NAME to your own wandb project, or if you don't want to use it, jus delete every line realated to waandb in model_train.py
